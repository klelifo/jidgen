======

Jidgen is an easy-to-use, but powerful Java-based id generator. 
It uses templates for automated id generation and optional collision detection to avoid duplicate ids.

jidgen is a Java-based id generator that can be
used as a command line program or as a library.
The idea is to make automated generation of user
IDs as easy as possible by introducing a simple,
straightforward template language to describe the
structure of the desired IDs. jidgen uses 100%
Java and is thus platform independent. Itsupports
collision filters for different backends to ensure
the generated ID is unique in your environment.
Blacklists are available to make sure all IDs are
socially acceptable. As a command line program, it
can easily be accessed by scripts or directly by
the user. As an embedded library, it can easily be
employed in the process of automated ID generation
and suggestion.
